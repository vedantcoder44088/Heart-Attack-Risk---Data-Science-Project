## Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. This project focuses on predicting the risk of a heart attack using various attributes like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc. By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to create an effective and reliable prediction system.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various health indicators like:
- Age
- Gender
- Cholesterol levels
- Blood Pressure
- Smoking status
- Diabetes status
- Heart rate
- And more...

The data is sourced from a publicly available heart disease dataset, which is pre-processed and split into training and test sets for building machine learning models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical computing)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
- XGBoost (Gradient boosting model)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantcoder44088/Heart-Attack-Risk---Data-Science-Project.git
   cd Heart-Attack-Risk---Data-Science-Project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Heart_Attack_Risk_Prediction.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells step by step to explore data, preprocess it, and train machine learning models.
3. Evaluate the models on the test data to predict heart attack risks.

Alternatively, you can run the model training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Model Evaluation

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

## Results

After training and evaluating the models, the XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy and AUC-ROC score, making it the most effective model for predicting heart attack risk.

| Model              | Accuracy | AUC-ROC |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression| 85%      | 0.88    |
| Decision Tree      | 83%      | 0.86    |
| Random Forest      | 88%      | 0.91    |
| XGBoost            | 90%      | 0.93    |

## Future Work

- Explore more advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Deploy the best-performing model as a web application.
- Integrate real-time data for continuous monitoring.
- Expand the dataset for more diverse results.
